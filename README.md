#JSON Parser

##About
This project is a simple JSON validator and parser.
It includes a simple flask server to host a web page that can connect to the validation endpoint.
This endpoint validates a submitted JSON string, and parses it if it is valid.

##License
None (yet). Do with it what you will!
